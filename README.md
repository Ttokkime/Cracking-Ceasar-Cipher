# Cracking Caesar's Cipher
For context, Ceasar's cipher is method of encoding messages that uses a number to shift the letters according to their positions in the alphabet. For this project, it will decode the messages that were encrypted with the Ceaser cipher to get the original message. 

### Project 
My project does:
- Import the string library to access more characters.
- Share an opening message with the user that describes what the program will do.
- Include user input for the encrypted message (capital letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and keyboard symbols).
- Include a for loop that cycles through all 93 key possibilities.
- Include a for loop that cycles through each character in the initialMessage.
- Include a conditional statement that allows for multiple word messages.
- Define and call a function called decrypt() that stores code that decrypts the ciphertext.
- Define and call a function called wraparound() that stores code to adjust the position of any wraparound characters.
- Display all 93 key possibilities in the console window using string formatting.
- Provide a closing message that shares with the user to search through the 93 possibilities to find their plaintext message.

## File Overview

### ← README.md

README.md file give you more documentation and information about a program. They are super helpful for describing what a program should do, any issues you've encountered, changes you want to make, and more. 

### ← main.py
This is where you will write your main program.
