# Cracking Caesar's Cipher
For context, Ceasar's cipher is method of encoding messages that uses a number to shift the letters according to their positions in the alphabet. For this project, it will decode the messages that were encrypted with the Ceaser cipher to get the original message. 

### Project 
My project can:
- Import the string library to access more characters.
- Share an opening message with the user to describe what the program will do.
- Get the user input for the encrypted message (capital letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and keyboard symbols).
- Cycle through through all 93 key possibilities and through each character of the message.
- Decrypt the message using a decrpyt funtion
- Display all 93 key possibilities in the console window
- Give a closing message that tells the user to look through the 93 key possibilites to find that seems the most likely to be the original message.
